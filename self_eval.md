# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    I feel very confident in my understanding and fluency with comparison operators. I am going to need to slow down to verify that I am using the greater than and less than symbols correctly in order to avoid any mistakes.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    The logical operators make a lot of sense to me as well. While evaluating statements I just need to look for either the "and" or the "or" in the question to determine which symbols to use.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    If statements make sense to me, I found out one time that I forgot to end the statement and it didn't run, but I was able to quickly recognize the mistake. 
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    I spent an hour on this assignment, and I budgeted an hour in my calendar for it. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    I had some issues running the `if_statements.rb` command in my terminal, but when I would run the code in the irb section of my terminal it ran correctly. I am going to go back and see if I can find out why running the code without being in the irb wasn't working. 
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    The question I have is addressed above and I'm going to go to my small group with it.
